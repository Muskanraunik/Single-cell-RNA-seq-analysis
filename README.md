# Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis
This pipeline processes raw reads to generate gene expression profiles using the standard Cell Ranger toolkit and performs downstream analysis with various R packages.
# Required Packages
* Seurat: For single-cell RNA-seq analysis.
* ggplot2: For plotting graphs.
* dplyr: For efficient data manipulation.
* SingleR: For cell type annotation.
* celldex: For reference datasets used in cell type annotation.
* MAST: For differential expression analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics.
# Installation
Install the required packages using the appropriate R commands.
# Input
* The pipeline requires barcodes.tsv.gz, features.tsv.gz, and matrix.mtx.gz files.
* These files should be generated by the Cell Ranger pipeline and placed in the appropriate directory.
# Workflow
1. Loading Data
* Load the necessary libraries and data files into a Seurat object.
2. Quality Control and Filtering
* Filter cells based on quality control metrics to ensure high-quality data.
3. Normalization and Identification of Highly Variable Genes
* Normalize the data and identify highly variable genes for downstream analysis.
4. Scaling and Principal Component Analysis
* Scale the data and perform PCA to reduce dimensionality.
5. Clustering and UMAP Visualization
* Cluster the cells and visualize them using UMAP for better understanding of the data structure.
6. Annotation
* Annotate cell types using SingleR and celldex reference datasets.
7. Differential Expression Analysis
* Perform differential expression analysis using the MAST package.
# Plotting
* UMAP Plot
  * Use DimPlot to create UMAP visualizations of the single-cell data.
  * UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimension reduction technique that is often used to visualize the clustering of cells in a low-dimensional space.
* Feature Plot
  * Create VlnPlot to visualize the expression of specific genes.
  * Violin plots show the distribution of gene expression levels across different cell groups or clusters, providing insights into the variability and distribution of gene expression within each group.
